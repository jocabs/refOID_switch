MIB: IF-MIB
The total number of octets received on the interface, including framing characters. This object is a 64-bit version of ifInOctets. Discontinuities in the value of this counter can occur at re-initialization of the management system, and at other times as indicated by the value of ifCounterDiscontinuityTime.

MIB: IF-MIB
The total number of octets transmitted out of the interface, including framing characters. This object is a 64-bit version of ifOutOctets.Discontinuities in the value of this counter can occur at re-initialization of the management system, and at other times as indicated by the value of ifCounterDiscontinuityTime.

Interface {#IFNAME}({#IFALIAS}): Inbound packets discarded

3m
7d
365d
MIB: IF-MIB
The number of inbound packets which were chosen to be discarded
even though no errors had been detected to prevent their being deliverable to a higher-layer protocol.
One possible reason for discarding such a packet could be to free up buffer space.
Discontinuities in the value of this counter can occur at re-initialization of the management system,
and at other times as indicated by the value of ifCounterDiscontinuityTime.

Interface {#IFNAME}({#IFALIAS}): Inbound packets with errors
net.if.in.errors[ifInErrors.{#SNMPINDEX}]
1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.14.{#SNMPINDEX}
3m
MIB: IF-MIB
For packet-oriented interfaces, the number of inbound packets that contained errors preventing them from being deliverable to a higher-layer protocol.  For character-oriented or fixed-length interfaces, the number of inbound transmission units that contained errors preventing them from being deliverable to a higher-layer protocol. Discontinuities in the value of this counter can occur at re-initialization of the management system, and at other times as indicated by the value of ifCounterDiscontinuityTime.

Interface {#IFNAME}({#IFALIAS}): Interface type
net.if.type[ifType.{#SNMPINDEX}]
1h
7d
MIB: IF-MIB
The type of interface.
Additional values for ifType are assigned by the Internet Assigned NumbersAuthority (IANA),
through updating the syntax of the IANAifType textual convention.

Interface {#IFNAME}({#IFALIAS}): Operational status
net.if.status[ifOperStatus.{#SNMPINDEX}]
1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.8.{#SNMPINDEX}
1m
7d
MIB: IF-MIB
The current operational state of the interface.
- The testing(3) state indicates that no operational packet scan be passed
- If ifAdminStatus is down(2) then ifOperStatus should be down(2)
- If ifAdminStatus is changed to up(1) then ifOperStatus should change to up(1) if the interface is ready to transmit and receive network traffic
- It should change todormant(5) if the interface is waiting for external actions (such as a serial line waiting for an incoming connection)
- It should remain in the down(2) state if and only if there is a fault that prevents it from going to the up(1) state
- It should remain in the notPresent(6) state if the interface has missing(typically, hardware) components.

The number of outbound packets which were chosen to be discarded
even though no errors had been detected to prevent their being deliverable to a higher-layer protocol.
One possible reason for discarding such a packet could be to free up buffer space.
Discontinuities in the value of this counter can occur at re-initialization of the management system,

MIB: IF-MIB
For packet-oriented interfaces, the number of outbound packets that contained errors preventing them from being deliverable to a higher-layer protocol.  For character-oriented or fixed-length interfaces, the number of outbound transmission units that contained errors preventing them from being deliverable to a higher-layer protocol. Discontinuities in the value of this counter can occur at re-initialization of the management system, and at other times as indicated by the value of ifCounterDiscontinuityTime.

Interface {#IFNAME}({#IFALIAS}): Speed
net.if.speed[ifHighSpeed.{#SNMPINDEX}]
bps
5m
7d
MIB: IF-MIB
An estimate of the interface's current bandwidth in units of 1,000,000 bits per second. If this object reports a value of `n' then the speed of the interface is somewhere in the range of `n-500,000' to`n+499,999'.  For interfaces which do not vary in bandwidth or for those where no accurate estimation can be made, this object should contain the nominal bandwidth. For a sub-layer which has no concept of bandwidth, this object should be zero.
